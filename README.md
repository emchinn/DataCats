A team submission to the 2025 Women in Data Science (WiDS) Datathon. Predicting both an individual’s sex and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis using adolescent functional brain imaging data and patient socio-demographic, emotions, and parenting information.

### Challenge
“What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?”

Using fMRI data, the task is to build a model to predict both an individual’s sex and their ADHD diagnosis.
The multi-outcome model should predict two separate target variables: 
1) ADHD - 0: noADHD, 1: ADHD 
2) gender - 0: male, 1: female

### Background
Neuropsychiatric disorders that occur in development, like anxiety, depression, autism, and ADHD, often differ in how and to what extent they affect males and females. ADHD occurs in about 11% of adolescents, with around 14% of boys and 8% of girls having a diagnosis. There is some evidence that girls with ADHD can often go undiagnosed, as they tend to have more inattentive symptoms which are harder to detect. Girls with ADHD who are undiagnosed will continue suffering with symptoms that burden their mental health and capacity to function.

### Importance
ADHD can be difficult to diagnose in females. Tools like machine learning have the potential to help identify individuals who may be at risk. Importantly, they might help shed light on the parts of the brain relevant to ADHD in females and males, which in turn could lead to improvements in personalized medicine and therapies. Identifying ADHD early and designing therapies targeting specific brain mechanisms in a personalized way can greatly improve the mental health of affected individuals.

### WiDS
The WiDS Datathon Global Challenge was developed with Ann S. Bowers Women’s Brain Health Initiative (WBHI) in collaboration with Cornell University and UC Santa Barbara. Datasets and support are provided by the Healthy Brain Network (HBN), the signature scientific initiative of the Child Mind Institute, and the Reproducible Brain Charts project (RBC).
